Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela (/mænˈdɛlə/;[1] Xhosa: [xolíɬaɬa mandɛ̂ːla]; 18 July 1918 – 5 December 2013) was a South African anti-apartheid revolutionary, political leader, and philanthropist who served as President of South Africa from 1994 to 1999. He was the country's first black head of state and the first elected in a fully representative democratic election. His government focused on dismantling the legacy of apartheid by tackling institutionalised racism and fostering racial reconciliation. Ideologically an African nationalist and socialist, he served as President of the African National Congress (ANC) party from 1991 to 1997.

A Xhosa, Mandela was born to the Thembu royal family in Mvezo, British South Africa. He studied law at the University of Fort Hare and the University of Witwatersrand. He began his law practice in Johannesburg, where he became involved in anti-colonial and African nationalist politics. He joined the ANC in 1943 and co-founded its Youth League in 1944. After the National Party's white-only government gained power and established apartheid, a system of racial segregation that privileged whites, Mandela and the ANC committed themselves to its overthrow.

  <h2><u>President Nelson MANDELA</u></h2>
<P>Mandela was appointed President of the ANC's Transvaal branch, rising to prominence for his involvement in <strong>the 1952 </strongDefiance Campaign and the 1955 Congress of the People. He was repeatedly arrested for what the government termed as seditious activities and was unsuccessfully prosecuted in the 1956 Treason Trial. Influenced by Marxism, he secretly joined<strong> the banned South African Communist Party (SACP)</strong>. Although initially committed to non-violent protest, in association with the SACP Mandela co-founded the militant Umkhonto we<strong> Sizwe in 1961</strong>, and led a sabotage campaign against the government. He was arrested and imprisoned in 1962. Following the Rivonia Trial, he was convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment on charges of conspiring to overthrow the state.
